PyMontrol is a library to control data flow using python and MongoDB

Design phylosophy:
Quick and clean way to achieve data flow that can sustain small to medium scale service deployment.
Large scale will be supported by hosting the worker and controller on to cloud functions
each worker work with 1 python interpreter



To use:
either 1a subscribe a mongodb.com replica set or 1.b self host a recplica set
2. change /src/credential/mongo_sample.json name to /src/credential/mongo.json with connection string properly set
3 .open a python console that run control.py
4 .after implementing worker.processdata and another python console that run worker.py, can be on same or distributed machines
the data uploaded to db = eventTrigger , collection name = input_data_packet will be allocated to the worker

Issues:
Very litter is done to worker monitor
